                    This project investigates how sargassum affects Belize’s beaches, coral reefs, and tourism industry. 
                    We collected real data by measuring seawater quality, observing coral health, surveying tourists, 
                    and interviewing local businesses. Our goal is to provide insights to help protect Belize’s environment 
                    and economy.

                    Sargassum is a floating brown seaweed that naturally grows in the ocean.
                    Offshore, it provides food and shelter for marine life. However, when
                    large amounts wash onto Belize’s beaches, it begins to decompose and
                    causes serious environmental and economic problems.

            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>
                    Climate change, warmer ocean temperatures, and nutrient runoff from
                    agriculture increase sargassum growth. Ocean currents then carry
                    these large mats toward the Caribbean, including Belize’s coastline.

                <p>
                    Tourism is one of Belize’s main sources of income. When sargassum
                    piles up on beaches, it creates strong odors, dark water, and
                    unattractive shorelines. This discourages tourists from swimming,
                    snorkeling, and visiting coastal areas.

                <p>
                    As sargassum decomposes, it lowers oxygen levels and can reduce the pH
                    of seawater, making it more acidic. These conditions stress coral reefs,
                    contribute to coral bleaching, and harm marine biodiversity.

                    This project uses the scientific method. We formed a hypothesis that
                    decomposing sargassum lowers seawater pH and harms coral reefs and
                    tourism. We test this by measuring water quality, observing coral
                    health, and collecting real data.

                <p>
                    We hypothesize that when sargassum decomposes on Belize’s beaches, 
                    it lowers seawater pH, harms coral reefs, and negatively impacts tourism. 
                    This is based on observations of water quality changes and reports from local communities and tourists.

                    We use a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data includes seawater
                    pH testing, water clarity, and beach coverage of sargassum. Qualitative
                    data includes surveys from tourists and interviews with local businesses
                    about tourism impacts.

                    Sargassum is not just an environmental issue. It affects Belize’s
                    economy, coastal communities, and natural heritage. Understanding
                    this problem helps guide better decisions to protect beaches, coral
                    reefs, and the tourism industry.
